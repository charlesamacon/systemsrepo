man			User Commands

Name
	man - displays the manual page for a given command

Synopsis
	man [SHORT-OPTION]...

Description

	man is the system's manual pager. Each page argument given to man is
	normally the name of a program, utility or function. The manual page
	associated with each of these arguments is then found and displayed.

	For the time being, this version of man will display the entire manual
	page for a given command. Whether or not this will persist in the final
	project remains to be seen. Short, sweet, and to the point right now.

	Currently implemented man pages:
	echo
	cpusage
	man

Examples
	
	man ls
		Display the manual page for the program ls.

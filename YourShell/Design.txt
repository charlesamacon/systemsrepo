Very basically:

shell.c
-All of our includes
-pid_d stuff
-main()
{  // I think we should leave the currenty ysh.c main intact as it already has line parsing
    - status of child(ren)
    - return value of waitPID stuff

    while (quit == false)
    {
        - wait for background processes to do their thing
        - this is where we handle the strings (send them to a function for this?)
        - error checking is done here (or in the parser...probably in the parser)
    }

   
}

-line parser()
{
    - parse lines into usable chunks
        -create a multidimensional (at least 2d) array for chunks
    - check for piping (if there's a pipe, move to the next main index of the chunk array)
   
    - This area is very much akin to one of the first programs that we wrote in this class (the command line arguments, etc.).

    - After parsing, we essentially go into:
    for (each "main index" of the chunk array)
    {
        - execute each command (with its particular command line arguments) in execute();
        - if there is piping, these need to be done concurrently, so we should consider this greatly.
    }

    - Any clean up that is needed.
}

-execute()
{
    - child_pid stuff in here?
    - check to make sure the command line arguments make sense (error handling)
    - execute the programs as defined elsewhere (echo, ls, etc.)
}

Everything else that's already in ysh.c should go here (fill_argv, copy_envp, get_path_string, etc.)

shell.h
-Anything that we need to make sure is defined goes in here.
-Any structs that we need to define, etc.

progs.c
-This is where everything that we're going to have to hard code should go
-echo()
{
    - make sure variables are properly returned
    - etc.
}
-man()
{
    - include a man page for each of the functions that we're implementing
    - Need new man pages for echo (works differently), cpuUsage, bash++, the extra Linux util.
}
-cpuUsage()
{
    - determine how much CPU has been used (on average) over the last 24 hours.
    - The current line of thinking is that this should be done using top to get a snapshot of the current CPU usage
    - This should be done in the background every hour and added to a "rolling" log file that keeps track of the previous 24-hour period.
    - This function would then, essentially, return an average of those values.
}
-bash++()
{
    - our bash++ precompiler should go here.
    - this will be corrected and will be using standard I/O instead of file I/O.
}
-extraLinuxUtil()
{
    - whatever that may be goes here.
}
redirect(){
    - Takes output of command and writes its output to a specified file.
}
background(){
    - Creates a forked process when the '&' char is found for the preceeding process..
}
Piping(){
    - Creates 2 processes where the output of one is the input to the other.
}


progs.h
etc., etc., etc.
